# Comparative analysis between types of queries and IR models using TREC-COVID
> This repository refers to the final work for Information Retrieval class, lectured by Professor Giseli Lopes of Computer Science Department at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

This work aims to retrieve information and evaluation its results using as document collection a subset of CORD-19 and TREC-COVID's test collection. This repository has the report that talks about the whole project and the implementation itself. The results generated by this application is not satisfing in terms of precision but, with them, I could conclude interesting points related to quality of documents collection and the importance of tokenization and stemming. 


## Requirements


## How to run the application

Before you run the application, you must open the file "main.py" and choose which IR model do you want to execute, changing the global variable which goes inside the function "run".
```python

BOOLEAN = 0
VECTORIAL = 1
PROBABILISTIC = 2


run(PROBABILISTIC)
```

Windows:
```sh
py main.py
```
or 
```sh
python main.py
```
